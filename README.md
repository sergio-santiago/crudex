# Crudex
> ðŸ§ª This project is experimental and intended for testing AI-assisted code generation using OpenAI Codex.  

## Description

`crudex` is a minimal command-line application for performing CRUD operations on a SQLite database.  
It is designed to be lightweight, dependency-free, and easy to understand â€” ideal for experimenting with code generation, prototyping, or educational use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher  
- No external database server is required, it uses SQLite by default.

## Usage

You can run the application via the provided `Makefile`. Simply running `make`
will launch the interactive console.

### Comandos de consola

```bash
make list
make add NAME="Sergio Santiago" EMAIL="sergio@example.com"
make get ID=1
make update ID=1 NAME="Sandra Alonso" EMAIL="sandra@example.com"
make delete ID=1
make console
make purge
```

### Comandos manuales

```bash
python app.py list
python app.py add "Name" "email@example.com"
```

## Running tests

Install the testing dependency (also available via `make install-dependencies`):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the suite with:

```bash
pytest -q
```
